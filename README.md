Note: Currently only specifically allowed Spotify accounts can sign in on this website. I'm awaiting acceptance of a quota extension request, which will allow anyone who visits the website to sign in to their Spotify account.

This is a responsive React app that makes use of the [Recharts library](https://recharts.org/) and the [styled-components library](https://styled-components.com/). When you sign in to your Spotify account, you can view various aspects of your Spotify listening data represented by pie charts.
